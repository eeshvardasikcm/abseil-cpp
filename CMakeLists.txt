# I am not personally providing support for this project.
# Please report any build issues directly to me by creating a new pull request to
# this less-cmake-dev branch of my abseil-cpp fork.
# If you are new to making pull requests on GitHub, please try your best to
# create any pull request that passes GitHub pull requst validation on 
# this brancs of my fork, and include some notes in the text area 
# box so I can handle your request according to your notes. If you would like to
# GitHub with me on one of my other repositories or forks, please go to those
# particular repositories or forks and have my GitHub pinged from there.
# Thank you,

# I, EeshvarDasIKCM, have passed through some introductory tutorials on the cmake 
# website and am actively developing using cmake from what cmake offers in those
# particular introductory lessons. I have not achieved any official training or 
# credentials in developing using cmake. I have acquired certification in C++, 
# and am actively studying to receive additional certifications in C++.
# I am having difficulty using abseil across some of my environments
# and use cases. Abseil is working good for me in some of my environments.
# In efforts for my development process to continue proceeding 
# smoothly, I am forking abseil. I currently have no plans to merge this branch into the
# original abseil-cpp repository. More likely, but not planned, would be that
# I make a pull request directly from my main fork. My less-cmake-dev2 branch
# is created for that purpose of sharing any new findings of mine back to
# the main abseil project repository.
