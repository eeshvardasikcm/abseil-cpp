## Approaching compatibility with abseil-cpp philosophy
After thinking about how my current coinng habits may cause some
potential lack of compatibility with abseil-cpp philosophy,
I am understanding that I could make a complete and full
pull request to the Google abseil-cpp repository with only a
small addition of exception handling code to my modifications, and 
my code would be an improvement to the abseil-cpp repository implementation.
However, I don't think that adding exception handling would present
code in such a beautiful manner that abseil-cpp is currently 
presenting their C++ code.

The next step I should take is to
study more about the abseil-cpp philosophy to discover some more
potential faults that my understanding of why Google abseil-cpp is
carrying on with a beautiful tactic instead of using a more robust
and comprehensive code writing tactic. I'm understanding that I may
discover that the abseil-cpp beauty is not simply surface layer, but
also has perfection that extends deeply.
