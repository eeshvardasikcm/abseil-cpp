# I have added this eeshvardasikcm.txt file

# I am not personally providing support for this project.
# Any issues with the origin abseil-cpp repository should be made directly
# to the abseil-cpp team on their repository.
# Please report any build issues on this fork directly to me by creating a new 
# pull request to this less-cmake-dev branch of my abseil-cpp fork.
# If you are new to making pull requests on GitHub, please try your best to
# create any pull request that passes GitHub pull request validation on
# this branch of my fork, and include some notes in the text area
# box so I can handle your request according to your notes. If you would like to
# GitHub with me on one of my other repositories or forks, please go to those
# particular repositories or forks and have my GitHub pinged from there.
# Thank you,

# I, EeshvarDasIKCM, have acquired certification in C++, 
# and am actively studying to receive additional certifications in C++.
# I am having difficulty using abseil across some of my environments
# and use cases. Abseil is working good for me in some of my environments.
# In efforts for my development process to continue proceeding 
# smoothly, I am forking abseil. I currently have no plans to merge this branch into the
# original abseil-cpp repository. This fixes branch may possibly lead to my discovery
# of how to proceed contributing to the abseil-cpp repository. If I do discover
# how to answer some issues on the origin abseil-cpp repository, I would likely
# make a new branch at that time. I have looked through some of the current issues,
# and have some fixes in mind, but I really don't know the overall style and
# code writing principles currently behind abseil, so I will continue down this
# course of action right now as 
# to avoid causing any unnecessary work for the abseil team.

# Joke: John Cage could make a better composition than abseil, then again maybe not if abseil was a composer,
# but abseil is not a composer. I have composed some music and set it to a video in a film format.
# I don't care if any of the abseil authors have done the same.
# I don't see any abseil compositions on Google Play Music, or YouTube.
# Not that I'm replacing C++ with music composition.
# I'm not a composer and I don't know if composers can even do that.
# EndOfJoke.
# I wonder if that track on Google Play Music called Abseil Technimatic has anything to do with abseil.
# Anyway, this track appears to be more of a vj mix than a composition to me, but I am not a music expert.
# Does that mean all the vj mix fans and enthusiasts should be renamed, modified, and brought in compliance?
# I don't think so, but I don't know.

# abseil has one major flaw that my redesign of abseil considers unnecessary to fix.
# abseil explains upfront "Why Adopt Abseil", not "Why not adopt Abseil".
# (https://abseil.io/about/) Abseil about page has only "Why Adopt Abseil".
# the "Why Adopt Abseil" page excludes those that don't learn Abseil.
# abseil has potential diamond dependency issues present, requiring compliance.
# I am not sure how much study it will require to learn abseil.
# This redesign fork of abseil starts at this point.
# Hopefully fixes to the actual abseil will result from this fork.
# My study of abseil will first have to achieve sufficient compliance.
# If that time ever appears, I may revisit my fixes-dev branch of abseil.
# This redesign concept of mine appears to go along with the design of abseil.

# abseil prioritizes actively used features over features that are not.
